# RStudio

**R** is a powerful tool for bioinformatics, offering **a wide range of pre-built packages** for various analyses. You can run R **on your local machine** by **installing R and RStudio** on your desktop or laptop.

{% hint style="info" %}
**R and RStudio are not the same**—R is the programming language, while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a user-friendly interface for writing and running R code. You’ll need to install both to use R effectively.
{% endhint %}

{% step %}
### Download and install R

Firstly, you'll have to install R on your computer. Go to [Comprehensive R Archive Network website (CRAN) 🔗](https://cran.r-project.org/).&#x20;

Depending on your operating system (OS), either click **Download R for macOS** or **Download R for Windows**.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="MacOS" %}
Go to **Latest release.** If you are using older Intel Mac device, click on **R-4.x.x-x86\_64.pkg**. If you are using Apple silicon Mac device, click **R-4.x.x-arm64.pkg** to download the installer.&#x20;

Once the installer is downloaded, install R by running the **.pkg** file.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}

Click **base**.

Click **Download R-4.x.x for Windows**, and run **R-4.x.x-win.exe** to launch the installer.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find and install **different versions of R** on CRAN, if required by software.
{% endhint %}

R is installed to your computer, let's install **RStudio** to use R.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Download and install RStudio Desktop

Follow [this link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to find the download link for RStudio Desktop.

Scroll down to find the installer right for your OS.

Download and run the installer.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Open RStudio
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is what you'll see when you open RStudio.

The **left** panel, called **console**, is where you interact with R directly.

### Console

* You can type R commands here line-by-line and see the output immediately.
* It currently shows the R version (`4.5.1`) and some default instructions.
* The `>` symbol is the prompt where you type your R code.

<details>

<summary>Top-right panel</summary>

#### **Environment Tab (default)**

* Displays all current objects (e.g., data frames, variables, functions) in your R session.
* Right now it says “Environment is empty” because you haven’t defined or loaded any objects yet.

#### **Other Tabs:**

* **History**: Shows previously executed commands.
* **Connections**: Used for connecting to databases (rarely used by beginners).
* **Tutorial**: Some versions offer interactive learning here (depends on configuration).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Bottom-right panel</summary>

The **bottom-right** panel has six panels: **Files**, **Plots**, **Packages**, **Help**, **Viewer**, and **Presentation**

**Files Tab (default)**

* Shows the files and folders in your working directory.
* You can navigate directories, open files, and manage project structure.
* Buttons like `New Folder`, `New File`, `Delete`, `Rename`, etc., are for managing files.
* You’re currently in the **Home** directory.

**Other Tabs:**

* **Plots**: Displays plots generated by R.
* **Packages**: Lets you manage (install/load/unload) R packages.
* **Help**: Documentation for functions and packages.
* **Viewer**: For rendering web content like HTML reports.
* **Presentation**: Used for R Markdown slides (if applicable).

</details>





In most cases, you’ll primarily use three tabs: the **Console**, the **Environment**, and the **Plots** tab. You’ll enter R commands in the **Console** and see the results there. The **Environment** tab shows the objects created in your session. If your code generates a plot, it will appear in the **Plots** tab in the bottom-right pane.

This is an example of RStudio in use, with plots generated from the data. While the code is running, the `>` prompt on console will disappear, indicating that R is busy. You can only enter a new command once the current one has finished and the prompt reappears.

Also, instead of typing codes line-by-line on the console, you can open a new R script file by clicking **File > New File > R script**. This allows you to copy all the code you need to be pasted into the top-left panel, and you can run the code line-by-line by clicking **Run** button on the panel.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The command line your keyboard cursor is indicating will be automatically passed down to console and run, showing the result on console.&#x20;

Enjoy using RStudio!
