# \[Recommended] ARC Workshops

Before we move on to setting the environments, there are a couple of online courses you can enroll to if you are an absolute beginner to the non-graphic Linux environment.

If you are not used to dealing with  we recommend enrolling to [**ARC – Introducing the Unix Shell**](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/enrol/index.php?id=12953) on **UCL Moodle**. (A **shell** is a program that executes other programs in response to text commands, Unix Shell is used in Linux.)

The course provides video descriptions of how to deal with files and directories, running loops, and scripting on UNIX shell.



Another course we recommend is [**ARC - Introduction to High Performance Computing at UCL**](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/enrol/index.php?id=33216).&#x20;
