# Understanding nf-core

[**nf-core**](https://nf-co.re/) is a community-driven, standardized collection of curated pipelines built using **Nextflow**.\
It includes a wide range of pipelines—such as **rnaseq**, **sarek**, **nanoseq**, **chipseq**, **methylseq**, and many more.\
You simply choose the pipeline that matches the type of analysis you want to perform.

<table><thead><tr><th width="106.08203125">Pipeline</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>rnaseq</td><td>RNA sequencing analysis using STAR, RSEM, HISAT2 or Salmon with gene/isoform counts and extensive quality control.</td></tr><tr><td>sarek</td><td>To detect germline or somatic variants (pre-processing, variant calling and annotation) from WGS / targeted sequencing</td></tr><tr><td>nanoseq</td><td>Nanopore demultiplexing, QC and alignment</td></tr><tr><td>chipseq</td><td>ChIP-seq peak-calling, QC and differential analysis</td></tr><tr><td>methylseq</td><td>Methylation (Bisulfite-Sequencing) analysis using Bismark or bwa-meth + MethylDackel</td></tr></tbody></table>
